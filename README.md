# üåê WebSocket Example: JavaScript

This project is a basic application that uses **WebSocket** in **Node.js** to establish a two-way communication between the server and the client. The goal is to demonstrate how WebSocket allows a persistent connection to be maintained, allowing the server to send periodic messages to the client without requiring a new request.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Steps to Set Up and Run the Project**  

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository  
Use the following command to clone the project from GitHub:  
```
git clone https://github.com/ciizao/WebSocket_JavaScript.git
```
### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Navigate to the Project Directory
Go to the project directory with the following command:
 ```
cd  WebSocket_JavaScript
```
### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Initialize the Node.js Project
If the `package.json` file hasn't been created yet, run the following command to initialize the project:
`npm init -y`

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Install the necessary dependencies by running the following command:
 ```
npm install ws
```
- This will install the **`ws`** library, which is used to create the WebSocket server in Node.js.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£  Run the Server
Start the WebSocket server by running the following command:
 ```
node server.js
```
- WebSocket server is listening on port `8080`

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ Open the Client
Open the **`index.html`** file in your browser. This file contains the client-side code that connects to the WebSocket server.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£  Look Communication
- Once the client connects to the server, the console and the browser will display a successful connection message. And a message from the client on the server.

- Also, in the browser interface, you will see messages sent from the server, such as:
`Message 1 from the server Message 2 from the server`

- *The server sends a new message every 30 seconds, with an incremented counter, to demonstrate the persistent connection.
